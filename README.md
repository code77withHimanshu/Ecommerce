# Ecommerce
It is an Ecommerce store. This store is managing its products, user interactions, and backend processes effectively. 
It can be used both by customers and vendors. 
The customers can view products(added by vendors), add them to their cart, place an order etc.
The vendors can view products, add products, update products(like name, description, price, category, image etc.), delete products, manage orders by changing their status to pending, shipped, completed, cancelled etc

User can also change their password by clicking on the avatar.
There is a Search button and products are filtered by categories


### Payment Gateway Integration
Note: A payment gateway has not been integrated into this application. This decision was made due to the requirement of sharing sensitive bank account details, which I am not comfortable providing to payment gateways.

If the role or job requirements necessitate the inclusion of a payment gateway, I am prepared to implement it and will address this integration accordingly.

### Step-1
Clone the repository and open in VS code.
 - `git clone git@github.com:code77withHimanshu/Ecommerce.git`

### Step-2
Open the terminal and write the following commands

- `cd .\backend\`
- `npm install`
- `node server.js`

This will run the server on the local and you will see MySQL Connected...


### Step-3
Open another terminal and write the following commands

- `cd .\frontend\`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

This will start the frontend on the local



### Step-4
Go to Login and access the dummy user i.e.
